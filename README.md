An analysis of the Zeus Trojan, also known as ZBot, reveals its sophistication, impact, and the methods used to dissect its behavior. First discovered in 2007, Zeus is a notorious banking trojan designed primarily to steal financial information, such as online banking credentials and credit card data. Its global impact, technical complexity, and long-lasting influence on modern malware make it a significant case study in cybercrime evolution. The Trojan successfully infected millions of systems worldwide, targeting banks, corporations, and government agencies, which led to billions of dollars in financial losses.

### **Operational Mechanics and Infection**

Zeus typically infects systems through phishing emails, malicious downloads, and exploit kits. Once executed, a dropper installs the core bot, which ensures its persistence by modifying registry keys or creating scheduled tasks to run automatically on reboot. To remain hidden, the malware injects itself into legitimate Windows processes like `explorer.exe` or web browsers.

A critical component of its operation is its command-and-control (C2) infrastructure. The malware connects to its C2 server, often using encrypted HTTP or HTTPS communication that mimics normal web traffic, to download an encrypted configuration file. This file contains instructions on which financial institutions to target and which backup servers to use. When a victim visits a targeted website, Zeus employs techniques like form grabbing and man-in-the-browser (MitB) attacks to capture sensitive data, such as login credentials and session information, before it is encrypted by the browser. It can also inject malicious HTML or JavaScript into legitimate webpages to trick users into providing additional information like PINs. All stolen data is encrypted and sent back to the C2 server.

### **Malware Analysis Findings**

Static and dynamic analysis techniques were used to understand the malware's capabilities and behavior.

**Static Analysis:**
* **Suspicious API Calls:** The analysis identified blacklisted Windows API calls that suggest malicious activity, including `WriteFile`, `WinExec`, and `GetClipboardData`. The malware also leverages critical system DLLs like `KERNEL32.dll`, `USER32.dll`, and `SHLWAPI.dll` to interact with the operating system stealthily.
* **Defense Evasion:** Using the Capa tool, the analysis revealed anti-analysis capabilities, including checks for virtualized or sandbox environments. The malware employs techniques like Heaven's Gate to switch to 64-bit code and evade detection.
* **Embedded URL:** An embedded URL, `corect.com`, was found within the binaries. While the site itself is a harmless Romanian news website, its inclusion could be a decoy or a method to hide C2 communication.

**Dynamic Analysis:**
* **System Disruption:** In a controlled Cuckoo Sandbox environment, the malware was observed stopping active Windows services such as `mpssve` and `SharedAccess` to weaken system defenses.
* **Persistence and Injection:** Zeus ensures its continued presence by installing itself to autorun at Windows startup. It performs process injection, embedding malicious code into trusted system processes to hide its activity. For instance, it was observed injecting code into `cmd.exe` to execute system commands.
* **File Dropping:** The malware drops additional files on the system, including its primary executable (`invoice_2318362983713_823931342io.pdf.exe`) and other components to maintain persistence.
* **Network Activity:** Network analysis revealed that the Trojan communicates with its C2 infrastructure using encrypted or obfuscated protocols. Suricata alerts confirmed that it attempted to connect to IP addresses associated with known malicious activity.

### **Impact and Prevention**

The impact of Zeus is severe for both individuals and financial institutions. For end-users, an infection leads to the theft of sensitive credentials and significant system performance degradation due to the malware's constant monitoring. For financial institutions, Zeus poses a massive threat by enabling credential harvesting (including two-factor authentication codes) and unauthorized transactions, resulting in millions of dollars in losses.

The leak of Zeus's source code in 2011 led to the creation of numerous powerful variants like Gameover Zeus and Citadel, ensuring its legacy continues. To combat this persistent threat, a multi-layered defense is necessary. Key preventive measures include:
* **User Education:** Training users to recognize phishing attempts.
* **Technical Controls:** Implementing robust email filtering, network segmentation, and regular software patching.
* **Advanced Security:** Using sandboxing solutions to analyze suspicious files and deploying advanced threat detection tools to monitor for malicious behaviors like process injection.
